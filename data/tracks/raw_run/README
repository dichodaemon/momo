These text files contain raw data from the simulator in the following format

[Frame Time AgentID Agent_X Agent_Y AgentType]

The agent of interest here is agent type == 2 which is the robot.
In all scenarios, the robot starts at (100,20) and has a goal directly ahead at (100,220) 
hence moving a total of 200 units in the y direction (directly upwards).

The agents either start at the top, to the right or both corresponding the three cases in
the paper. The numbers are 10 for each origin except in the last scenario where only 5 agents
start from the right. The scene files show these better with descriptions of expected behavior
of the robot.
