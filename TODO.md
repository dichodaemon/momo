New TODO
========

  * 










TODO
====

  * Integral images for feature expectation in Henry (GPU)
  * Check path rasterization
  * Correct irl.plan to do 1 step replanning
  * Try to do forward and backwards simultaneously
  * Correct handling of duplicate names in tick_tack
  * What if we don't normalize the expected counts?
  * What if we normalize the weight vector?
  * Verify correctness of observed feature computation

DONE
====
  * Grid is inverted in opencl calculations, needs to be standardized
  * Current error is in rebase and position calculation in computeCosts and computeFeatures
  * Check usage of float version of DIRECTIONS
  * Check world2 orientation cw/ccw
  * Check goal orientation
  * Check consequences of stopping using DIRECTIONS with real length
  * Optimize observed feature computations
